        Barney's Coffeeshop
      </header>

    </div>
    <p class = "list">
      This is my favourite coffeeshop in the whole city. It is very close to my house and as
      such has provided countless good experiences for my friends and I. If you are ever in
      Amsterdam I highly reccommend going there, they have friendly service, incredible
      products, and an awesome menu for food and snacks that make it an unbeatable experience
      in my eyes.

        The Foodhallen
      </header>

    </div>
    <p class = "list">
      If you are looking for a nice lunch or dinner experience in Amsterdam the Foodhallen is the place
      to go. It has an open market style experience, with different bars selling different types of
      food and drink, ranging from sushi to french cheese and craft beer. It is an incredible environment
      to spend time in, a lot of people gather to meet with friends and have drinks in the evening, and this
      would be one of the highest recommendations I have for food in the entire city.
    </p>
    <p class = "list">
      <bold>Recommendation:</bold> The Gin and Tonic bar is unbeatable.

        The Vondelpark
      </header>

    </div>
    <p class = "list">
      An amazing place to take your family or your friends. This is a beautiful area of the city, big open spaces
      and always a lovely atmosphere. On a sunny day, biking through this area is one of the highlights
      of any trip, and of course, bringing your own food and settling down for a picnic is highly reccomended. If you
      can, try and go on the weekend where you will see all of the locals out and about with music playing and good
      vibes all around.

      <bold>Recommendation:</bold> Vanilla Bean Latte
